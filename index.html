            Northeastern University is on track to meet our commitment of 80% reduction in Metric Tons of Carbon Equivalent (MTCO2e) emissions from 2005 levels by 2050 on a gross square foot (gsf) basis of facilities-controlled buildings and transportation. Facilities Management is deeply committed to achieving these goals.
