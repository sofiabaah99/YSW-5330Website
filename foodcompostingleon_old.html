        Every day in the campus of Northeastern University, much food is produced and consumed. However, at the same time, there are much food wasted. Composting is one way to dispose them, which is a process of transforming organic materials, such as fruit and vegetable scraps, into nutrient-rich soil that can be used for gardening and farming. By composting, university can reduce their environmental impact, lower their waste disposal costs, and support local food systems.

          The volume of food composting has been changed dramatically during the year of 2021 to 2023. During the season of  holiday, the volume will drop down and reach a peak after those holidays. Also, the total volume of food composting is various largely with locations. Especially, through the comparison, it could be found that INV Loading Dock and Stetson West Loading Dock have a significant volume of composting, followed by Curry/ELL Compactor Area. Now just have a look on what is going on on these locations.
